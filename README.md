# SNSapplication-CPhw6
* Computer Programming (2020 Fall) Homework 6 - making an SNS Application
* Other assignments of this course is not uploaded here because the skeleton codes for those assignments were given. This project made with C++ is meaningful due to the fact that I built this up starting with nothing given!
